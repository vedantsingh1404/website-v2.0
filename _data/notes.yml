    BoTW : Finally done with all the divine beasts. Took me ~45 hours and a plethora of beautiful screenshots to get to this point. Will complete more side quests before going on to fight Ganon. Also, the shrine count has reached north of 70.

    Didn't think selecting a good (and cheap) domain name would be such a difficult task. I am currently inclined towards vedantsingh.tech.
    Edit : Domain was bought succesfully from [domain.com](https://www.domain.com/).
